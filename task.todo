TODOs (✔/☐)

☐ Find a way to add generic URLs as constants
☐ Recreate the container each time we change the file, watchdog. Annoying in development process if not...
☐ Do not need docker-compose.yml with Dockerfile enough. I have only one service
✔ Do not know which is the reason to not get the outputs messages in the terminal
☐ Move all the stdout messages to one file and create logs file
☐ Maybe for daily update, make a query to get just the actual day meetups
